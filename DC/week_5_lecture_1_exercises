//Error located/explained.

var firstName = "Julia";
var lastName = "Roberts";
var fullName = firstName + lastname; //The error occurs here "lastname is not defined. It should be written lastName as that variable was previously defined on line 2"

console.log(fullName); // Julia Roberts


//Corrected code.

var firstName = "Julia";
var lastName = "Roberts";
var fullName = firstName + lastName; //Corrected variable name so code executes as expected. Modified to include space between firstName and lastName.

console.log(fullName); // Julia Roberts
