C. try/catch: The try statement lets you test a block of code for errors.

The catch statement lets you handle the error.

The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.

The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.

The try/catch/finally statement handles some or all of the errors that may occur in a block of code, while still running code.
